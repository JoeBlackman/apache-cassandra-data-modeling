# **SUMMARY**

The purpose of this project is to create an Apache Cassandra database with an appropriate data model for optimal querying of user activity data. The raw user activity data is in the form of csv files generated by the sparkify app and needs to be properly mapped to the tables of the Apache Cassandra keyspace.

# **INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Open a terminal
2. Change directory to your project directory that contains Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb
3. Activate the python environment that you typically use for data engineering
4. Call pip freeze and ensure that all packages imported in the notebook file are installed
5. Open the Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb file with jupyter notebook
6. Change the kernel to the python environment you typically use for data engineering (Kernel -> Change Kernel -> your_data_engineering_environment. you may need to add the environment as a jupyter kernel: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html)
7. Run each code cell in the notebook
8. Verify the results of the queries in the cells at the end of the notebook.
